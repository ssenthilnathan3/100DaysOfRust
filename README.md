# 100DaysOfRust
#100DaysOfCode is a commonly known challenge used in various communities across the internet. So, I decided to start this challenge because I can't commit to anything properly so I thought by commiting to this challenge I will be accountable to my github profile and others who watch my github repos. So If you are feeling like this, I think you should use this method to learn practically anything out there. I chose rust because it deals with low-level
programming w.r.to the system. And I love the name "**RUST**".
